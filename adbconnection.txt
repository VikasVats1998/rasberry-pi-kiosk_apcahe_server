Ensure the folder contains files like adb.exe, fastboot.exe, and AdbWinApi.dll.
Step 3: Add ADB to Your System PATH (Optional)
Adding ADB to your system's PATH variable allows you to run adb commands from any folder in the Command Prompt.

Press Windows + S, type Environment Variables, and select Edit the system environment variables.
Click Environment Variables in the dialog box.
Under System Variables, find and select Path, then click Edit.
Click New and add the folder path where you extracted ADB (e.g., C:\adb).
Click OK to save your changes.
Step 4: Connect NVIDIA Shield TV
Ensure that Network Debugging is enabled on your Shield TV:
Go to Settings → Developer Options → Network Debugging and turn it ON.
Find the Shield TV's IP address:
Go to Settings → Device Preferences → About → Status → IP Address.

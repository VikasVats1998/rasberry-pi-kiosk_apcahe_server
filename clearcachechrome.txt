To automatically clear the Chromium browser cache on your Raspberry Pi 5, we'll combine a shell script with a cron job. The script will delete the cache files, and the cron job will schedule the script to run at your desired intervals.

Steps:

Create a Script:

Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi.
Use a text editor like nano or vim to create a new script:

sudo nano clear_cache.sh

Use code with caution.

Paste the following script into the editor:

#!/bin/bash
# Clear Chromium cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/Chromium/Default/Cache/*

Use code with caution.

Save the script and make it executable:

sudo chmod +x clear_cache.sh

Use code with caution.

Set Up a Cron Job:

Open the crontab editor:

sudo crontab -e

Use code with caution.

Add a line to schedule the script to run at your desired time and interval. For example, to run it every day at 3 AM:

0 3 * * * /path/to/your/script/clear_cache.sh

Replace /path/to/your/script/clear_cache.sh with the actual path to your script.

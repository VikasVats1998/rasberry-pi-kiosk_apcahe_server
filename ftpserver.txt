How to setup a FTP server on rasberry pi
Step 1: Install vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon)
	This is a popular FTP server that works well on Raspberry Pi.

	Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
	Update your package lists:

	sudo apt update
Install vsftpd:

	sudo apt install vsftpd

Step 2: Configure vsftpd
	Now, you’ll need to modify the vsftpd configuration file to allow FTP access to the /var/www/html/ directory.

	Open the configuration file:

	sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf

	Make the following changes:

	Find anonymous_enable=YES and change it to:

		anonymous_enable=NO
		local_enable=YES
		write_enable=YES

	Add the following line at the end of the file to restrict users to their home directories:

		chroot_local_user=YES

If you want to allow users to navigate outside their home directory (to /var/www/html), you can add the following lines:

		allow_writeable_chroot=YES
			Save and close the file (press CTRL+X, then Y, and Enter).

Step 3: Create a User for FTP Access
	You’ll need to create a user or modify an existing user that has access to /var/www/html/.

Create a new user (or skip this if you already have one):

	sudo adduser ftpuser

	Set the user’s home directory to /var/www/html/:


	sudo usermod -d /var/www/html ftpuser
	Set proper permissions for the /var/www/html/ directory:

	sudo chown -R ftpuser:ftpuser /var/www/html
Step 4: Restart vsftpd
	After making the changes, restart the vsftpd service to apply them:

	sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

Step 5: Connect via FileZilla
Open FileZilla on your computer.

Enter the following details:

Host: Your Raspberry Pi’s IP address.
Username: The username you created or your default one (e.g., ftpuser).
Password: The password for the user.
Port: 21.
Click Quickconnect and you should be able to access the /var/www/html/ directory and manage files.

How to change FTP user password

1. List FTP Users
The users for your FTP server are typically defined in the system's user database. You can view the users who have been created on your Raspberry Pi by checking the /etc/passwd file. To list all users, you can run:

	cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

2. Change FTP User Passwords
To change the password for a specific user on your Raspberry Pi, you can use the passwd command. Here’s how:

Open the terminal.

Run the following command, replacing username with the actual username:


sudo passwd username
You will be prompted to enter a new password and confirm it.

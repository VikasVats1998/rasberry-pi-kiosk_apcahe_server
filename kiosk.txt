New Update Kiosk

Prerequisites
Install LabWC if it is not already installed.

On Debian-based systems:

sudo apt install labwc
On Arch-based systems:

sudo pacman -S labwc
Create a new user (optional but recommended for security).

Use a dedicated kiosk user with restricted permissions.


sudo adduser kiosk-user
Set up LabWC autostart for the kiosk user.

Steps to Configure Kiosk Mode
Create an autostart script for LabWC that launches the desired application in fullscreen on startup.


mkdir -p ~/.config/labwc
nano ~/.config/labwc/autostart
Edit the autostart file to launch your application in fullscreen. Here’s an example if you’re using a web browser like Firefox or Chromium:


#!/bin/sh
# Launch the application in fullscreen mode
chromium --kiosk "http://your-url-here.com" &
Replace "http://your-url-here.com" with the URL you want to display. For local applications, replace chromium with the executable path or command of your application.

Make the autostart script executable:

chmod +x ~/.config/labwc/autostart
Disable input options (optional). If you don’t want users to close the application or switch to other windows, you may want to disable keybindings and cursor visibility in LabWC.

To disable keybindings, edit the LabWC configuration file (you may need to create it if it doesn’t exist):


nano ~/.config/labwc/config
Add the following lines to disable keybindings:


# Disable all bindings
bindings = false
Optionally, you can hide the mouse cursor using an additional tool like unclutter:


sudo apt install unclutter
unclutter &
Test the configuration by logging in as the kiosk user and running LabWC:


labwc
LabWC should start, and your application should open in fullscreen, effectively providing a kiosk experience.

Autologin and Automatic Startup (Optional)
For a fully autonomous kiosk, set up autologin for the kiosk user:

Enable autologin by editing the display manager's configuration file (varies by DM, such as lightdm, gdm, or sddm).

Configure the session to start LabWC upon login.

For example, with LightDM, edit the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file and set:


[Seat:*]
autologin-user=kiosk-user
user-session=labwc
